## Wayki App

Wayki App was built for the Make It Real bootcamp as a team project. The app is meant to help missing pets find their way home. For the frontend development we used React, React Bootstrap, React Router. In the backend NodeJs with Express, and MongoDB with Mongoose. End to end tests were made with Cypress. The frontend was deployed in Netlify and the backend in Heroku. The app also uses token authentication with JWT. We used Permissions API, Google Maps API, Geolocation, Reverse Geocoding, GeoJSON standard and services like Sendgrid, MongoDBAtlas and Cloudinary.
